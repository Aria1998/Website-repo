      <p class="lead"> Ever missed a couple of lessons at school and struggle to find good notes on what you missed? Or have you ever tackled with piles of books and revision sheets unable to find the notes you want? </p> 
      <p class="lead"> Studyshare is a website for students from primary school all the way to university. The main idea is to allow students across the world to share and save notes about different educational subjects. Through this platform, we hope to solve the problem of unclear, unorganised notes and make school life that little bit easier.</p>
